    <li>Built three major integrations with our CRM platform, to enhance the data and save time by avoiding duplicate data entry.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed an application that allowed the Finance department to plan changes to interest rates, have another user approve the changes(with ability to see what exactly was changing), and export/upload the necessary data file to our Bank core.  This was previously managed with Excel SpreadSheets with multiple people touching the files and manual updates of the rates in the Bank core.
